# Module 2.10 Creating Custom Representation Models

We will mostly likely need to customize the model to our specific tasks and the type of data we're dealing with. This is where **finetuning** comes in. The baseline model comes with pre-trained data, but finetuning can build on that by taking in and adapting to our own data. This will result in a custom model that is more suited to perform at the task we want it to.

Cohere has a finetuning function on their dashboard. 

1. Submit a .csv file of at least 250 data points. Sample: 

| Query | Intent |
|--|--|
| please give me round trip fares from baltimore to philadelphia | atis_airfare |
| is there ground transportation from atlanta airport to downtown atlanta |atis_ground_service
| please give me round trip fares from baltimore to philadelphia | atis_airfare |
| please give me round trip fares from baltimore to philadelphia | atis_airline |

3. Train the dataset 
4. Review the metrics such as Accuracy, Loss, F1, Precision, Recall
5. Optionally, regenerate the embeddings to see how the groupings changed.
