## Controlling the Model Output

There are two ways to decided when the model should stop:

- **Number of Words**. The model will stop once it reaches the max number of words specified by this parameter.
- **Stop Sequence**. The model will stop once it reaches the sequence of characters specified by this parameter. For example, if I set the stop sequence to "Hello" and tell it to say hello 5 times, it will only say "Hello" once.


## Creativity vs Predictability
The way that text generation works is that it has a list of possible results all with a likeliness score. The words with higher likeliness are more likely to be selected. There are two parameters that can be used to adjust this behaviour.

- **Randomness** - how the model chooses from its next choice of tokens. Higher temperature means more predictable. Lower temperature means more creative.

- **Top-K** - the list in which the model can make its choices from. Default is 0, meaning that the model will consider all possible next tokes out of 1000s of possible tokens. If this is changed to say 100, it would only consider the top 100 most probably tokens.
