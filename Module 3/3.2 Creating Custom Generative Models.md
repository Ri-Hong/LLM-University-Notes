# Module 3.2 Creating Custom Generative Models

In order to add some customizability to its models, Cohere offers a way to finetune the models to perform better at a specific task.

**Finetuning** involves taking a pre-trained language model and training it on a smaller, more specific dataset to adapt it to a specific task.

To finetune a model, cohere takes in a JSONL file, filled with prompts and completions. E.g.

    {"prompt": "This is example prompt #1", "completion": "This is the completion example #1"} 
    {"prompt": "This is example prompt #2", "completion": "This is the completion example #2"} 
    ... 
    ... 
    {"prompt": "This is example prompt #N", "completion": "This is the completion example #N"}

Note: The minimum number of examples cohere accepts is 32, but for best performance, we would need hundreds or thousands of examples.

## Evaluating a Custom Model

### Metrics
When you go to the custom (aka finetuned) model's page, there will be 2 metrics shown: Accuracy and Loss. 
- **Accuracy** - measures how many predictions the model made correctly out of all predictions
- **Loss** - measures how bad or wrong a prediction is. Accuracy tells us how many predictions are wrong, but loss tells us how wrong (to what degree).
