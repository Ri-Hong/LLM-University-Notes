# Appendix 1.6 How to Build a Classifier

## Cleaning the Data
The goal of this step is to remove noise and improve the quality of the data through the following steps

- split the sentences into words using tokenization
- using a dictionary of stop words, filter out all stop words, numbers, and punctuations present 
- Perform the stemming process by transforming words that have prefixes or suffixes appended to them into their corresponding root word

## Text Vectorization
Recall that vectorization is the process of converting words into a numeric representation. We can use the aforementioned bag-of-words algorithm to accomplish this.

## Training the model
We can use the methods mentioned in the previous module. However, since we're building a classifier, the niave Bayes' algorithm works well.

We need to split our dataset into training and testing data. Usually the split is recommended to be 70% training and 30% testing.

## Performance Evaluation


In this step, we feed the model our test data. This is because the model has not seen the data before and thus reduces bias in the test results.

We will then compare the predicted value to the actual value in order to calculate the model's accuracy.
